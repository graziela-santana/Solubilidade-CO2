<h3 align="center"> Supervised Regression Learning Project - Prediction of CO2 Solubility in Brine </h3>

- 🔍 Solubility of CO2 in brine is fundamental for simulating and designing chemical processes, including CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage). The goal of the project is to predict the most accurate results based on the temperature, pressure, and salinity of the system.

- ⚙ The modeling and analysis were made through Python libraries Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Feature-Engine, Optuna, XGBoost and Tensorflow
